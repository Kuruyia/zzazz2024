# Challenges

This contains some files about the hacking challenges.

## Hacking Challenge III - gbhttp

- [`gbhttp.asm`](./gbhttp.asm) - The source file of the amazing GBZ80 HTTP server with (almost) no security flaws! (this contains some of my annotations to the - unfortunately - present security flaws)
- [`streq.asm`](./streq.asm) - A lightweight version of the `gbhttp.asm` file so I could test whether the `_StrEq_` function was exploitable (it was not).

## Hacking Challenge IV - Pok√©mon Write-What-Where Version (Emerald)

- [`solution.txt`](./solution.txt) - My solution file to this challenge.

From the event website:

```
Solutions to the challenge should be provided in a simple text file format, which is defined below:

- The solution file might contain any number of lines (it doesn't matter if Windows or Unix line endings are used).
- If a line starts with the character ";", it is treated as a comment and ignored.
- If a line is empty, it is ignored.
- Otherwise, the line is treated as a memory write definition, which is a list of space-separated values:
    - The first value is the decimal number of the frame on which the write should occur.
    - The second value is the hexadecimal pointer to the memory address which should be written.
    - All remaining values are treated as a list of hexadecimal bytes which should be written to that address.
- Values might be separated from each other by any number of whitespace.
