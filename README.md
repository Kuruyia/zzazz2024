# TheZZAZZGlitch Fools 2024 - Glitch Lord's Final Stand - Kuruyia

This repo contains some codes and notes about how I've done the challenges of [TheZZAZZGlitch's April Fools Event 2024](https://zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2024/index.html) (funny meme intro video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvfFRbwwwn0)).

[The results video](https://youtu.be/OqeNu3nfDhA) is now available, go check it out to see what the other participants have done and to learn more about this event!

I'd like to thank [TheZZAZZGlitch](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheZZAZZGlitch) for organizing this event once again, as well as the community for playing it. Once again, I had a very fun week trying to overcome the challenges that it had to offer.

I've participated in the 2018 and 2022 events, and am very happy to be a part of the event once more!

For this year's April Fools Event, TheZZAZZGlitch set the bar very high up. We got a very nice Pokémon Mystery Dungeon-inspired game (this time, it is a full standalone GameMaker game and not a funky save file), with, like the previous times, an online leaderboard with a lot of challenges that gets unlocked as you progress through the game. It was very impressive, and a bit hard too, but a really cool thing to play!

I will not really talk about the game itself and its challenges here (I was too lazy to finish them all, and the game gets very hard after finishing it :c), and focus more on the traditional hacking challenges that this year offers us.

This was a bit different from the previous years, as the hacking challenges were directly available online and not in a spooky scary dark cr4ck cavern. There were four challenges in total, that could be completed in any order, and it is noted that "Their difficulty is equivalent to 3rd-4th tiers of previous years.".

So, let's check them out!

This document is mostly dedicated to the [pret](https://github.com/pret) project and its contributors. Without it, it would have been a lot tougher to get over the challenges without the symbols and clear code they made available for everyone to see, so huge thanks!
