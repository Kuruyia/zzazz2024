# Hacking Challenge IV - Pokémon Write-What-Where Version (Emerald)

_"I love playing Pokémon Emerald! The buttons on my GBA are really worn off, and they don't work anymore... but who needs buttons when I have a debugger and a steady hand? As long as you tell me which memory addresses I need to modify on which frames, I should be good to go!_

_To complete this challenge, you will need to provide a solution file, which will contain a list of memory edits necessary to complete a fresh game of Pokémon Emerald from scratch. Completion is defined as viewing the credits. For more information about the file format, challenge premises and solution verification, visit the [Challenge IV: Information](https://fools2024.online/ch4.php) page."_
